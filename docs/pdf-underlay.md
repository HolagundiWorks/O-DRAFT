# PDF underlay for take-off

A project whose drawings exist only as PDF can be measured in O-Draft. The PDF page is read, drawn as ordinary
polylines on its own layer, calibrated to a real distance, and measured over with the same `takeoff.*` tools as
any drawing. This is item 3.5 of the O-CoreOp hand-off.

## Design

- **Vector PDFs only.** A plan exported from CAD is a PDF of vector paths. The reader (`crates/io/src/pdfread.rs`,
  `lopdf`, MIT, native builds only) interprets the page's path operators (`m l c v y re h`, `S s f F f* B b`,
  `q Q cm`, colour and width), including form XObjects (nesting capped at 8), and returns polylines in PDF points
  with the page origin at the lower left and the page rotation applied. Curves become 8 straight segments.
- **No new entity type.** Each path becomes an `LwPolyline` on the underlay layer (default `PDF-UNDERLAY`, grey).
  Snaps, selection, plotting and DXF save and reopen work as for any entity, and the take-off tools measure over it
  by drawing on the `MEASURE-*` layers as before. Nothing changes in the doc, DXF or render layers.
- **Not drawn, and said so:** text, images, shadings, clipping. A white path, and a fill covering the page, are
  taken to be the paper and dropped. A page with no vector lines (a scan, or only text) is refused with that reason
  and nothing is added.
- **Untrusted input:** at most 4 million operations, 200,000 paths and 2 million points per page, a 256 MB file
  limit, a 14,400 pt page limit, finite numbers only, encrypted PDFs refused. Errors are results, not panics.
- **The web build has no reader** (its random-number dependency has no web backend); the command then says PDF
  reading is not available.

## Commands (Architecture > Take-off)

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `underlay.attach {path, page?, at?, scale?, layer?}` | Reads the page and draws it. `at` is the lower left of the page (default `[0, 0]`); `scale` is drawing millimetres per paper millimetre (default 1, so the page arrives at paper size). Refuses a layer that already holds an underlay. The result warns that the scale is not known yet |
| `underlay.calibrate {p1, p2, length, unit?, layer?}` | Two points on the underlay a known real distance apart (`unit`: mm, cm, m, in, ft; default mm). Scales every line of the layer about `p1` so the points are that far apart, keeps the record (`scale`, `calibrated`). Refuses the same point twice, a non-positive length, an unknown unit and a factor beyond 1 : 1,000,000 |
| `underlay.list` | The attached underlays: layer, file, page, scale, calibrated, line count |
| `underlay.remove {layer?}` | Deletes the layer's lines and the record |

The attach and calibrate steps are single undo steps. The records are kept in the drawing's project data under
`underlay`.

## Workflow for a PDF-only project

1. Set the drawing units (`drawing.units`), then `underlay.attach` the plan.
2. Pick a dimension printed on the plan, or a known wall length, and `underlay.calibrate` with its two end points.
3. Draw the measure lines over the PDF on `MEASURE-FULLBRICK`, `MEASURE-COLUMN` and the other measure layers
   (osnap picks the PDF's line ends), run the `takeoff.*` tools, then `takeoff.record` as for any drawing.

## Importing a PDF as geometry (`pdf.import`)

`underlay.attach` is for measuring over a plan. `pdf.import {path, page?, at?, scale?, layers?, layer?, text?,
fills?, lineweights?, curves?}` brings a page in as drawing objects instead, in one undo step:

| PDF content | Becomes |
|---|---|
| stroked two-point path | `Line` |
| stroked path, closed or ending where it began | `LwPolyline` (closed when it closes); a round closed shape (a dozen points from curves, two dozen from short lines, within 1% of a circle) is a `Circle` |
| filled path | solid `Hatch` in the fill colour (a page-sized or white fill is the paper and is dropped) |
| text shown with a simple font, or a font with a ToUnicode map | `Text` at its position, angle and colour; height is 0.72 of the em size |
| optional-content group (what a CAD export writes for layers, O-Draft's own PDF export included) | the drawing layer of that name |

Everything else sorts by pen colour onto layers named `PDF-RRGGBB` (`layers: "colour"`, or the fallback for
paths outside any group); `layers: "single"` puts it all on `layer`. Black and white become colour 7, other
colours are kept as true colours, and line widths become the nearest standard lineweight. A PDF has no real
scale: the page arrives at `scale` (drawing millimetres per paper millimetre, default 1) and the result
reminds the user to check a known dimension. Not imported: images and shadings, clipping, text in a composite
font without a character map (counted in `skipped.text`), invisible OCR text. Curves are cut into line segments, so
an arc or spline becomes a polyline. Text is placed from the font size alone (no glyph widths), so a string
shown in pieces without repositioning can overlap.

Verified by `apps/aad-cli/tests/pdf_import.rs` (a layered drawing plotted by O-Draft comes back on its layers
with a line, a circle and a closed polyline; one undo step; colour and single-layer modes; text, a solid hatch,
the scale and the insertion point on a hand-made page; bad requests change nothing) and the reader tests in
`crates/io/src/pdfread.rs` (colours, optional-content names including UTF-16, text position, size, angle and
word gaps, invisible text, ToUnicode `bfchar` and `bfrange`, hostile marked content and maps). It has not been run
on PDFs written by other CAD programs.

## Tests

`apps/aad-cli/tests/underlay.rs` (real PDF writer and reader): a plan is plotted to PDF, attached to a fresh
drawing, calibrated from its 9 m edge (the 6 m side follows, scaled about the first point), a measure line over it
exports as a 9000 mm wall, undo restores the scale, removing leaves nothing; bad requests (missing file, page 0 or 2,
negative or huge scale, junk file, same layer twice, zero or negative length, unknown unit) change nothing; a page
with only text is refused with a reason. `crates/io/src/pdfread.rs` unit tests: a hand-made page gives its paths in
points under a transform, bad and truncated input is an error, a form that draws itself ends.

## Not done

- **Scanned (raster) PDFs.** Showing an image as an underlay needs an image entity and a decoder; none exists.
  The command says so instead of drawing nothing.
- The underlay draws no text (use `pdf.import` below when the text is wanted as text).
- A dialog or a pick-two-points prompt for calibration in the WinUI shell; today it is the JSON form (the
  menu entries run it with defaults and report what is missing).
- Several pages of one PDF in one step (attach each page on its own layer).
- Not run on PDFs from real CAD programs: only on PDFs this program writes and on hand-made pages.
