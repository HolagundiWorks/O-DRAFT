# Suite integration: what O-Draft has, what the contracts need

This page maps O-Draft in the O-Studio suite (O-Draft drawing, O-Studio office
management, O-CoreOp quantities and costing) with one
shared project identity in the **company file**. It describes O-Draft's side
only. Where it names O-Studio / O-CoreOp behaviour beyond what
O-Draft code proves, the statement is marked.

Nothing here is a claim that a full cross-application click-through has been
proven on a clean Windows machine. Section 5 lists what is built, what is
missing and what the first milestone needs.

## 1. Ownership

| Data | System of record | O-Draft's part |
|---|---|---|
| Drawing geometry, layers, blocks, layouts, undo, DXF/DWG | O-Draft (`aad-doc`, `aad-engine`) | Owns it. Other applications read it through commands, never through the document model |
| Company details (name, address, registrations) | O-Studio company file | Reads them (`companyfile`), prints them in the title block; never writes; when linked, refuses free typing of firm identity via `project` / wizard |
| Project name, site, client | Studio / O-Studio, in the company file | Reads them (`companyfile`); when `project_ref` is set, those detail keys are refresh-only in Draft |
| Quantities and costs | O-CoreOp | Produces measured quantities (`takeoff.*`) and a hand-off file (`bridge.export`); does not price |
| Reusable details and spatial records | (planned) | Component library in code today; not a separate spatial server |
| AI conversation, tool permissions, audit | Shared AI runtime (not built) | O-Draft has its own tool registry and audit log (`aad-agent`) for its own tools |

Rules O-Draft already follows and the suite should keep: a hand-off file never changes the drawing it
came from; imported text and tool results are data, not instructions ([ai-agent.md](../ai-agent.md)).

OSS suite apps do **not** ship an AORMS / portal connector. Company file is SoR.

## 2. What exists in O-Draft

| Capability | Where | State |
|---|---|---|
| Every action is a command with a JSON form, usable without a window | `crates/engine/src/cmd/*`, `Session::execute` | Implemented. This is the seam the suite should call |
| Control channel (loopback JSON lines) | `aad-host`, [control-protocol.md](../control-protocol.md) | Implemented: `engine.execute`, `cmdline.*`, `drawing.inspect`, `app.open`, `app.save` |
| MCP server over the same commands | `crates/mcp`, [mcp.md](../mcp.md) | Implemented |
| Typed agent tools with schema validation, risk classes, confirmation and an audit log | `crates/agent` | Implemented for O-Draft's own tools. Quantity take-off tools are reserved but not registered (`agent::PLANNED`) |
| Company / project details from the Studio company file | `crates/office`, `companyfile`, `project` suite lock | Implemented (read-only + refresh-only lock on linked detail keys; ticket / `context` only, no admin password UI; local `CompanyProfile` write gated when `OSAS_COMPANY` is set). Interactive project-picker UI still open |
| Quantity take-off from drawn geometry, rates, bill, opening schedule | `takeoff.*`, `schedule`, `openings.*` ([hcw-kit-port.md](../hcw-kit-port.md)) | Implemented; reads `MEASURE-*` layers |
| Parametric wall graph → measured facts | `aad-param`, `param.*` ([parametric.md](../parametric.md)) | Implemented (Rust evaluate/commit/undo; no node editor UI). Committed walls feed `bridge.export` / `takeoff.record` |
| Hand-off to and from O-CoreOp | `bridge.export`, `bridge.import`; file `hcw-aqc-bridge` version 1, millimetres, beside the drawing as `name.aqc.json` | Implemented. Import previews first and never changes geometry. Wall rows may come from brick take-off and/or parametric commit. CoreOp parses `source.project_ref` when present |
| Take-off in project file | `takeoff.record` / `takeoff.annotate` | Implemented; header carries company-file `project_ref` when linked ([PROJECT-FILE.md](../PROJECT-FILE.md)) |
| Spatial AI tools (overview, window, nearest, describe) | `crates/agent` | Implemented |
| Drawing-level change record (revision, checksum) | `revision.rs`, `drawing.revision`, `<file>.aadrev.json` | Implemented |
| Stable cross-application project and artifact references | `project_ref` from the company file in take-off / bridge headers | Partial: OSAS `ProjectRef` when linked via `companyfile`; no portal office-id key |

## 3. Contracts the suite needs from O-Draft

These are proposals. Each is a thin layer over commands that exist; none requires the shared
runtime to touch the document model.

| Contract | Proposed content | Built on |
|---|---|---|
| `DrawingRef` | project id, drawing id, path, DXF/DWG format, byte size | `Session` document state, `companyfile` / project details |
| `DrawingRevision` | `DrawingRef` + SHA-256 of the saved bytes + saved time + entity count | **new**: computed at save in `file.rs` (`commit_save`) and stored beside the file, not in the DXF |
| `QuantityTakeoff` | the saved `takeoff.*` results: item, group, length or area or count, unit, source layer, handles, rounding rule | `takeoff.list`, `bridge.export`, `takeoff.record` |
| `AuditEvent` | request number, tool, arguments, outcome, drawing revision before and after | `agent::AuditEntry`, extended with the revision |

An estimate built from a take-off must record the `DrawingRevision` it used, the measurement rules
(metric rounding to 1 cm, imperial to 1/8 in, deduction layers) and the rate schedule. O-Draft can
supply the first two; the third belongs to O-CoreOp.

## 4. The AI boundary

O-Draft's rule is that the model proposes and deterministic commands calculate ([ai-agent.md](../ai-agent.md)).
For a shared runtime that means:

- O-Draft registers its tools under a `cad.*` namespace with the schemas it already validates. The
  registry already declares a risk class and whether a call needs confirmation; a shared runtime
  should read those, not replace them.
- Write tools stay behind `Session::execute`, so undo, the locked-layer rules and the
  panic guard (`guard.rs`) apply to every caller.
- Offline mode: O-Draft's assistant runs a local model (`aad-llm`, llama.cpp) and sends no drawing
  content anywhere. A hosted model is not wired in and nothing in O-Draft requires one.
- The runtime must not get raw document access, arbitrary paths or SQL. The control channel and MCP
  already limit callers to named commands; the suite should use them as they are.

## 5. First milestone against O-Draft

Milestone 1 is "drawing to draft estimate". O-Draft's side, step by step:

| Step | O-Draft today | Gap |
|---|---|---|
| Open the project's linked drawing | `app.open` with paths from the launcher | The launcher supplies the paths; O-Draft does not look up drawing files by project id |
| Resolve the same project in O-CoreOp | OSAS `project_ref` when the drawing is linked via `companyfile` | CoreOp Import / Take-off consume the ref; Windows GUI E2E still open |
| Extract measurements | `takeoff.start` and `takeoff.*` over `MEASURE-*` layers | Needs a stated list of supported geometry; unsupported objects must be reported, not skipped silently (today `takeoff` reads the measure layers only) |
| Pass them on | `bridge.export` / `takeoff.record` | Done on Draft side; CoreOp reader built; product E2E open |
| Calculate quantities and cost | O-CoreOp | Not O-Draft's part (Studio surfaces estimate + RA totals on fee/invoice) |
| Draft fee / invoice in O-Studio | O-Studio | Not O-Draft's part |
| Reject unauthorised writes, keep an audit trail | agent confirmation policy and audit log | Done: the audit is persisted beside the drawing (section 6, step 4); sharing it across applications is not built |

## 6. Order of work in O-Draft

1. `DrawingRevision` at save, written beside the file; checked by `drawing.revision`. **Done.**
2. Rooms and the revision in `bridge.export`, as additive keys of format version 1. **Done.** CoreOp accepts extra keys / `project_ref` on import.
3. Register the existing take-off, room and revision commands as agent tools (read-only
   ones first), with schemas, in the existing registry. **Done** for the read-only ones (`get_takeoff_result`, `get_room_log`, `get_room_area_total`, `get_drawing_revision`, `check_permit_layers`). Commands that draw into the drawing (`schedule`, running a take-off) stay planned.
4. Persist the audit log next to the drawing revision it refers to. **Done**: `<drawing>.aadaudit.jsonl`, one line per proposed call.
5. **Next:** interactive company-file project picker UI; product E2E with CoreOp/Studio; scanned-PDF underlay polish.

## 7. Not decided here

The shared repository layout, the IPC protocol between applications, the shared identity and role
model, the indexing service and the installer coordination belong to a specification that covers all
suite repositories. Signing certs, release pins, and counsel review of dual licences
on AGPL apps are suite ops — not O-Draft licence changes (O-Draft stays MIT OR Apache-2.0).
