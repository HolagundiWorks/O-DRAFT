# Dynamo companion enhancement plan

**Status: in progress.** Phases 1–5 are implemented and verified (O-Dynamo `dotnet test`: 15
passed; O-Draft `cargo test -p aad-engine --test companion`: 11 passed). Phase 2 canvas ghost
overlay is deferred. Phase 6 has a JSON Graph side panel (visual node canvas still open).
Capability matrix: [status.md](status.md).

## Goal

Make the companion graph engine useful for real architectural plans by connecting it to
O-Draft's new features (levels, sheet sets, title plate, smart blocks, project details,
WinUI design system) while keeping both repos independently buildable and the pipe protocol
versionable.

## Inventory: what exists today

### O-Dynamo companion

| Project | What it does |
|---|---|
| `ODraft.Geometry` | `Vec2`, `Line2`, `Circle2`, `Box2`, `Draft2D` (Rectangle, WallOutline, OffsetOpen, PolygonArea, Bounds) |
| `ODraft.Units` | `Lengths` (mm ↔ m/cm/in/ft) |
| `ODraft.Graph` | `GraphEngine.Evaluate` with drafting + context + insert/title/annotation nodes, `GraphContext`, topological sort, diagnostics, geometry + `inserts`/`titleFields`/`texts`/`dimensions` |
| `ODynamo.Host` | WPF window (JSON editor + Run), pipe v2 (`evaluate`, `ping`, `context.*`, `subscribe`), named pipe `ODraft.Dynamo` |

### O-Draft engine commands that generate the same geometry

| Engine command | What it draws | Layer |
|---|---|---|
| `wall.draw` | Centre-line walls with offset faces | `A-WALL` |
| `wall.door` | Door opening (jamb gap + swing arc) | `A-DOOR` |
| `wall.window` | Window opening (jamb gap + mullion lines) | `A-GLAZ` |
| `grid.axis` | Axis grid with bay/row widths + bubbles | `S-GRID` |
| `column.place` | Columns at grid intersections | `S-COLS` |
| `stair.plan` | Straight or dog-leg stair with concrete quantity | `S-STRS` |
| `param.wall.new` / `param.commit` | Parametric wall (Rust graph, measured facts, take-off) | `A-WALL` |
| `sheet.designer` | Title plate layout with title block | — |
| `sheet.fields` | Title block attribute values | — |
| `level.new` / `level.activate` | Named model spaces | — |
| `sheetset.new` / `sheetset.activate` | Discipline annotation spaces | — |
| `project.setup` | Project with floors, heights, layer sets, tabs | — |

## Phases

### Phase 1 — New node types (O-Dynamo only) — **done**

**Goal:** The companion graph can produce doors, windows, columns, stairs and grid axes, not
just wall outlines and rectangles.

**Verified:** `dotnet test` on `ODraft.Graph.Tests` — 9 passed (3 existing + 5 node-type + 1 combined).
Sample graph: `ODynamo.Host/graphs/plan-elements.json`.

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `ODraft.Geometry/Geom2D.cs` | `Arc2`, `DraftGeom`, `GridGeom`; `DoorOpening`, `WindowOpening`, `ColumnRect`, `StairStraight`, `GridAxes` |
| `ODraft.Graph/GraphEngine.cs` | Nodes `door`, `window`, `column`, `stairStraight`, `gridAxis`; `GraphArc`; `GraphResult.Arcs` |
| `ODynamo.Host/PipeServer.cs` | Evaluate response includes `arcs` |
| `ODraft.Graph.Tests/GraphTests.cs` | One test per new node type plus a combined graph |

**Pipe output:** `result.arcs: [{cx, cy, r, startAngle, endAngle, layer}]` (radians, CCW from +X).

**No O-Draft changes.** The engine does not need to know about arcs from the companion until
Phase 3.

---

### Phase 2 — Pipe protocol v2: context and subscription (both repos) — **done** (ghost overlay deferred)

**Goal:** O-Draft sends drawing context (levels, project details) to the companion; the
companion can push live results without polling.

#### 2a — Context methods (O-Draft → Host)

Add two request methods to the pipe protocol:

| Method | Payload (from O-Draft) | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `context.levels` | `{ levels: [{name, elevation, height, active}] }` | Graph nodes can target a level |
| `context.project` | `{ name, owner, architect, units, scale, floors, … }` | Graph nodes can read project fields |

**O-Dynamo changes:**

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `PipeServer.cs` | Handle `context.levels` and `context.project`: store them in `_levels` and `_project` fields. Pass them to `GraphEngine.Evaluate` as an optional `GraphContext` parameter. |
| `ODraft.Graph/GraphContext.cs` | New record: `GraphContext(IReadOnlyList<LevelInfo> Levels, JsonElement Project)`. |
| `ODraft.Graph/GraphEngine.cs` | `Evaluate` accepts `GraphContext?`. New node types: `levelSelect` (dropdown, value is a level name, outputs the name as a string and the elevation/height as numbers), `projectField` (reads a named field from the project JSON). |
| Tests | `levelSelect` outputs the level name; `projectField` reads the project title. |

**O-Draft changes:**

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `crates/engine/src/cmd/companion.rs` (new) | `companion.connect {pipe?}` — opens the named pipe, sends `context.levels` and `context.project`, stores the pipe handle in `Session.companion`. `companion.disconnect`. `companion.evaluate` — calls `evaluate`, returns lines/circles/arcs. `companion.status` — reports connected/disconnected. |
| `crates/engine/src/cmd/mod.rs` | Register `companion::specs()`. |
| `apps/aad-winui/MainWindow.xaml.cs` | Menu item: Architecture > Companion > Connect / Disconnect / Evaluate / Commit. |
| Tests | `companion.connect` with no host returns a clear error, not a crash. |

The `ParametricBridge.cs` that was removed is **not restored**. The new `companion.*` commands
are engine commands, not UI code. The WinUI shell invokes them through `app.run`.

#### 2b — Live subscription (Host → O-Draft)

| Method | Direction | Payload |
|---|---|---|
| `subscribe` | O-Draft → Host | `{}` — the host will push `evaluation` messages whenever the graph changes (debounced 300 ms). |
| `evaluation` | Host → O-Draft (push) | Same shape as `evaluate` response. |
| `unsubscribe` | O-Draft → Host | Stop pushing. |
| `drawing.changed` | O-Draft → Host | `{ selection?, layers?, activeLevel? }` — optional, so `geom.path`-style nodes could track source entities. |

**O-Dynamo changes:**

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `PipeServer.cs` | Refactor from one-shot (read line, write line, close) to a persistent duplex connection. On `subscribe`, set a flag; on `GraphBox.TextChanged` (debounced), push an `evaluation` to the writer. On `unsubscribe` or disconnect, clear the flag. |
| `MainWindow.xaml.cs` | Wire `GraphBox.TextChanged` → debounced push. Show "O-Draft connected" in the status bar. |

**O-Draft changes:**

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `companion.rs` | `companion.connect` keeps the pipe open. A background task reads pushed `evaluation` messages and stores them in `Session.companion_preview`. The canvas draws the preview as a ghost overlay (faded, on a synthetic `_COMPANION` layer, not selectable). |
| `crates/aad-host/src/lib.rs` | Expose the companion preview lines to the renderer (same path as `param.evaluate` preview). |

**Verified:** Context nodes and pipe methods work; `companion.connect` without a host errors
clearly; subscribe stores pushed evaluations into `Session.companion` / `companion.preview`.

**Deferred:** Drawing the preview as a faded non-selectable canvas overlay (no GPU hook yet).

---

### Phase 3 — Level-aware commit (both repos) — **done**

**Goal:** Geometry from the companion lands on the correct level instead of always the first
model space.

**Verified:** O-Dynamo level-on-output test; `companion.commit` with Ground/First lines+circle,
store counts, and undo (`cargo test --test companion`: 8 passed).

Every output item has an optional `level` field (from a wired `levelSelect` or a string literal).
If absent, commit uses the active level (or `Level 1`).

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `GraphLine` / `GraphCircle` / `GraphArc` | Optional `Level` |
| `GraphEngine.cs` | Geometry nodes read `level` port / literal |
| `companion.commit` | Groups by level, creates missing levels, writes lines/circles/arcs, one undo step |

---

### Phase 4 — Smart-block insertion and title-plate fields (both repos) — **done**

**Verified:** O-Dynamo `blockInsert` / `titleField` tests; `companion.commit` places a known
block on Ground (warns and skips missing names), writes `REV`/`SCALE` onto the title block
(`cargo test --test companion`: 10 passed; `dotnet test`: 14 passed).

**Goal:** The graph can insert smart blocks from the discipline library and populate title-block
fields.

#### 4a — Smart-block insert node

**O-Dynamo changes:**

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `GraphEngine.cs` | New node type `blockInsert`: inputs `name` (block name from the library), `x`, `y`, `rotation`, and parameter ports (`width`, `height`, `type`, etc.). Output: a `GraphInsert` record. |
| `ODraft.Graph/GraphInsert.cs` | `record GraphInsert(string BlockName, double X, double Y, double Rotation, Dictionary<string, string> Attributes, string? Level)`. |
| `GraphResult` | Gains `IReadOnlyList<GraphInsert> Inserts`. |
| Tests | `blockInsert` node produces one insert with the given attributes. |

**O-Draft changes:**

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `companion.rs` | `companion.commit` handles `inserts` by calling the existing `insert` command for each, setting attributes from the dictionary, on the correct level. If the block name is not in the drawing, report a warning (do not crash). |

#### 4b — Title-plate field output

**O-Dynamo changes:**

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `GraphEngine.cs` | New node type `titleField`: inputs `field` (one of SCALE, REV, DATE, DRAWN_BY, etc.) and `value`. Output: a `GraphTitleField` record. |
| `GraphResult` | Gains `IReadOnlyList<GraphTitleField> TitleFields`. |

**O-Draft changes:**

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `companion.rs` | `companion.commit` calls `sheet.fields` with the collected title-field values. |
| Tests | A graph that sets `REV` to "A" results in the title block showing "A". |

**Done when:** A graph places a door block on "Ground" and sets the sheet revision to "B";
both appear in the drawing after commit.

---

### Phase 5 — Sheet-set annotation output (both repos) — **done**

**Verified:** `textNote` / `dimLinear` on Electrical for Ground land in the annotation store;
design store stays empty; design mode restored after commit (`cargo test --test companion`: 11
passed; `dotnet test`: 15 passed).

**Goal:** Text, dimensions and leaders from the graph go into a sheet-set annotation store, not
the design geometry.

**O-Dynamo changes:**

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `GraphEngine.cs` | New node types: `textNote` (inputs: text, x, y, height, rotation, layer, level, sheetSet), `dimLinear` (inputs: p1, p2, offset, layer, level, sheetSet). Output: `GraphText`, `GraphDimension` records. |
| `GraphResult` | Gains `Texts` and `Dimensions` lists. |

**O-Draft changes:**

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `companion.rs` | `companion.commit` switches to the named sheet set + level target (using `sheetset.activate` and `level.activate`), writes the text/dimension entities, then restores the original target. |
| Tests | A dimension on sheet set "Electrical" for level "Ground" lands in the annotation store, not the design store. |

**Done when:** `drawing.inspect` confirms the dimension is in the Electrical annotation for
Ground, and switching to Design mode does not show it.

---

### Phase 6 — WinUI graph editor (O-Draft only, optional) — **partial**

**Shipped:** Side rail **Graph** tab with JSON editor, Evaluate and Commit. When the sibling
`O-Dynamo` repo is present at build time (`ODRAFT_GRAPH`), Evaluate uses in-process
`GraphEngine`; Commit always uses `companion.commit`. Visual node canvas and full pipe removal
remain open.

**Goal:** Replace the WPF JSON editor with a node-graph panel inside the WinUI shell, removing
the separate process and the pipe.

**Approach:**

1. Reference `ODraft.Graph` and `ODraft.Geometry` directly from `Aad.WinUi.csproj` (they are
   netstandard2.0/net8.0, compatible with the WinUI project).
2. Build a `GraphPanel.xaml` that renders nodes as `Border` elements on a `Canvas`, ports as
   small circles, edges as `Path` elements. Use the WinUI design system tokens
   (`Density.CornerControl`, `Density.GapStandard`, `Tokens.SurfaceSecondary`).
3. `GraphEngine.Evaluate` runs in-process; no pipe. Results go directly to
   `companion.commit` via `app.run("companion.commit", json)`.
4. The side panel (right rail) gains a "Graph" tab. When collapsed, the rail shows "Graph";
   when open, the full node editor is visible.

**O-Dynamo remains buildable** as a standalone tool for users who prefer the separate window
or use it without O-Draft.

**Done when:** A wall + door graph can be built entirely in the side panel, committed to the
drawing, and undone. The WPF host still works independently.

## Phase dependency graph

```
Phase 1 (nodes)
    ↓
Phase 2a (context) ──→ Phase 2b (subscription)
    ↓                       ↓
Phase 3 (level commit) ←────┘
    ↓
Phase 4a (block insert)   Phase 4b (title fields)
    ↓                         ↓
Phase 5 (annotation) ←───────┘
    ↓
Phase 6 (WinUI editor, optional)
```

Phases 1 and 2a are independent and can run in parallel.

---

## Work estimates

| Phase | O-Dynamo | O-Draft | Tests | Total |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 — New nodes | Geometry + Engine: 5 node types, ~200 LOC | — | 5 tests | Small |
| 2a — Context | PipeServer + GraphContext: ~120 LOC | companion.rs: ~250 LOC, menu items | 4 tests | Medium |
| 2b — Subscription | Duplex pipe refactor: ~180 LOC | Background reader + ghost overlay: ~200 LOC | 2 tests | Medium |
| 3 — Level commit | Level field on output records: ~30 LOC | Level-grouped commit: ~150 LOC | 3 tests | Small |
| 4a — Block insert | GraphInsert + blockInsert node: ~80 LOC | Insert handling in commit: ~80 LOC | 2 tests | Small |
| 4b — Title fields | GraphTitleField + node: ~40 LOC | sheet.fields call: ~30 LOC | 1 test | Small |
| 5 — Annotation | Text/dimension nodes: ~120 LOC | Sheet-set target switch: ~100 LOC | 2 tests | Medium |
| 6 — WinUI editor | — | GraphPanel.xaml + canvas: ~800 LOC | 3 UI tests | Large |

## Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Pipe protocol breaks between versions | Version field (`v: 2`) on every message; host ignores unknown methods; O-Draft falls back to v1 if `context.*` is refused |
| Level names in the graph drift from the drawing | `context.levels` is sent on every connect and on every `level.new` / `level.set` / `level.delete`; the graph validates level names against the last context |
| Block names from the graph don't match the drawing | `companion.commit` warns (does not crash) and skips unknown blocks; the user sees which blocks are missing |
| WPF and WinUI in one solution | Phase 6 does not replace O-Dynamo; it adds an alternative. The pipe stays for the standalone host |
| Ghost preview performance | Preview lines are on a synthetic non-selectable layer; the renderer treats them like traces (cached, faded, no grips). Budget: 10 000 preview lines at 60 fps |

---

## Testing strategy

Every phase lands with:

1. **Unit tests** in `ODraft.Graph.Tests` (`dotnet test`) for every new node type and context
   method.
2. **Engine tests** in `crates/engine/tests/companion.rs` for `companion.connect` (mock pipe
   or error), `companion.commit` (entities on the right level/sheet-set), and hostile inputs
   (NaN coordinates, missing levels, empty graph).
3. **Integration test** via the control protocol: start O-Draft with `--control`, start
   `ODynamo.Host`, send `companion.connect` + `companion.evaluate` + `companion.commit` +
   `drawing.inspect`, assert entity counts.
4. **Quality gate:** `cargo xtask ci` (Rust) and `dotnet test` (C#) both pass before any
   commit.
