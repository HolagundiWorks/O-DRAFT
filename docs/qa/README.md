# O-Draft QA and performance campaign

Started: 2026-10-26. Working tree includes uncommitted UI consistency, polar tooltip,
eTransmit removal, and dynamic door/window work on top of `2f4af48`.

## Rules

- Numbers and pass/fail rows in these files are **measured or observed in this campaign**.
- Rows marked `not run`, `blocked`, or `hypothesis` are not claimed as verified.
- Pre-existing baselines in [PERFORMANCE.md](../PERFORMANCE.md) and [KNOWN_ISSUES.md](../KNOWN_ISSUES.md)
  are cited, not rewritten to look better.
- Related maintained docs stay authoritative for strategy; this folder is the campaign ledger.

| B Screen inventory | **done** (inventory; testing statuses still `not_tested`) |
| C Screen functional | **partial** — launch + Layer combo; Escape/dirty defects logged |
| D CAD commands / geometry | **partial** — wall/door engine smoke + existing unit tests |
| E Undo / documents | **partial** — one undo/redo smoke; WinUI dirty bug open |
| F DWG/DXF compatibility | **partial** — aad-io lib only |
| G Performance profiling | **not started** (baseline table only) |
| H Optimization | **not started** |
| I Stress / soak | **not started** |
| J Visual / a11y | **partial** — 2 screenshots |
| K Automated regression | **partial** — key crates; not full `xtask ci` |
